As a result, we consume less energy to operate production at The Mothership compared to standard snowboard factories. This commitment to energy efficiency aligns with our goal of <hl>minimizing environmental impact while maintaining high-quality snowboard manufacturing.<\/hl> <br><br>\n\nFurthermore, our low temperature pressing rooms employ plant-based bio resins with FSC certified wood cores, including hybrid cores with post-consumer recycled Thermopolymer additives. We also use water-based, UV-curable, and solventless inks for printing and zero toxic lacquer for topsheet application."
